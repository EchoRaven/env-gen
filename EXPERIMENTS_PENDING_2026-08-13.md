# Pending experimental verification — offline review of 2026-08-12/13

Everything in this session was derived from **kept artifacts only** (no generation runs). Each
fix below is proven correct at the unit level and its *premise* is measured against the corpus,
but its **effect on a live run** is not knowable offline. This file records exactly what a run
would have to show, so the next person with a run budget does not have to re-derive it.

Format per item: what was changed → what is already proven → **what only a run can settle** →
the cheapest observation that settles it.

## 1. #652 — rail/carousel position indicator

**Changed.** `_rail_pagination_652` emits a dots/bar indicator inside each rail block, gated on
the design's own enumeration.

**Proven offline.** 141 of 144 designs enumerate an indicator; only 7 of 144 delivered frontends
contain any dot-shaped element (verified by SHAPE, not wording); the gate fires on 141/144 with
78 dots / 63 bars; markup is deterministic and data-independent.

**Only a run can settle.** Whether the judge's `components` score on rail-bearing screens
actually rises. `components` is the floor dimension on 800 of 1254 scored records, so this is
the axis that gates — but a rendered indicator that does not match the reference's *position*
(the corpus roles say top-right for some rails, under-rail for others) could score neutral.

**Cheapest observation.** One run; diff `components.missing` on browse_home / movies / shows
against the r112-r144 baseline for the five wordings (`carousel pagination dots`,
`row pagination indicator dots`, `carousel pagination indicator`, `row pagination indicator`,
`row pagination dots`). Success = those five stop appearing. Watch also that `layout` does not
drop — the indicator adds vertical height to every rail block.

## 2. #653 — account menu behind the caret

**Changed.** The avatar chip is now a CSS-only disclosure (`group-hover` + `group-focus-within`)
containing a Sign-out menu item, instead of a button that logged you out on click.

**Proven offline.** 61 of 144 delivered frontends carry the chip; 61/61 render the caret; 44 of
them have no menu state anywhere. The logout action is preserved byte-for-byte.

**Only a run can settle.** (a) Whether the judge scores the closed state the same — the menu is
`hidden` at rest, so the screenshot should be unchanged, but the wrapper div could shift the
utility cluster by a pixel or two. (b) Whether a **user-agent** driving the app can now reach
account actions instead of being signed out. That is the standing goal's own test loop and
cannot be simulated offline.

**Cheapest observation.** A browser task that clicks the avatar and asserts it is still
authenticated afterwards. Before the fix that task fails 100% of the time by construction.

## 3. #654 — Kids chip target

**Changed.** The chip resolves its href from the app's registered routes; with no kids/family
route it renders as a badge (`<span>`) rather than linking to `/browse`.

**Proven offline.** 17 of 28 delivered navs contain two items pointing at one page, and 16 of
those 17 are this chip. No product literal remains.

**Only a run can settle.** Whether the judge treats a non-link badge as *present* (the design
enumerates a "kids profile chip"/"badge", which argues yes) or as *missing* (if its rubric keys
on it being a nav link). This is the one item where the fix could measurably lose a point while
being unambiguously more correct.

**Cheapest observation.** Same run as #652: check whether `kids profile chip` / `kids profile
badge` appear in `components.missing` more often than the baseline. If they do, keep the
behaviour and make the badge visually closer to the reference rather than reverting to a wrong
link.

## 4. #655 / #656 — wholesale-failure refunds

**Changed.** The auth re-mint retry now counts bounces by ROUTE, not by screen; the blank
`capture_transient` refund now fires on a near-total blackout, not only a total one.

**Proven offline.** r30/r49/r68 each had 10 of 12 screens bounce with `auth_unavailable` false
and no re-mint attempted; 18 of 58 blank events name 8+ screens; replayed against all six
corpus runs carrying blanks, #656 fires for r60/r43/r121 and not for r125/r72/r86.

**Only a run can settle.** Whether the extra re-mint / refund actually *recovers* those runs, or
merely spends one more capture pass before reaching the same verdict. The corpus records the
condition but not what a second attempt would have produced — that is the definition of an
experiment.

**Cheapest observation.** Any run that trips either condition: check whether the retry produced
a scored verdict, and whether `transient_refunds` stayed under `_TRANSIENT_REFUND_CAP` (3). If
a run burns all three refunds and still blanks, the cap is doing its job and the app was
genuinely broken — record that separately from "the retry helped".

## 5. #657 — profile-picker diagnosis

**Changed.** A screen stuck on the profile picker gets its own deviation text instead of "the
SPA never hydrated".

**Proven offline.** Nothing — deliberately. The two causes are indistinguishable in every
artifact a run leaves behind (same list, same message, and the picker path logs nothing), which
is precisely the defect. The fix is what makes it measurable.

**Only a run can settle.** How often the picker path actually fires, and whether the lane acts
correctly on the new instruction ("make profile selection persist") rather than the old wrong
one ("fix the page's mount/data load").

**Cheapest observation.** After one run, grep the verdicts for `never got past the PROFILE
PICKER`. Any hit is the first measurement of a rate that has never been observed. Zero hits over
several runs is also informative — it would mean the conflation was harmless in practice.

---

## 6. #658 — `submit_plan` above the auto-approve threshold

**Changed.** `BaseMessage(content=)` → `payload=`, so plans with more than
`_auto_approve_threshold` (3) steps no longer raise TypeError.

**Proven offline.** The crash and the fix are both demonstrated directly; the message now
reaches the bus with `payload["type"] == "plan_decision_request"`.

**Resolved offline, partly.** I flagged this as the file's highest risk — that a >3-step plan
would now stall 300s instead of crashing instantly — and then checked it. The loop IS closeable:
`accept_plan` / `request_plan_changes` set `_decision_events[plan_id]`, and the lead reaches a
pending plan through the `list_pending_plan_decisions` tool. What does not exist is a subscriber
for the `plan_decision_request` notification itself (grep finds only the sender and a test), so
the realistic failure is "the lead never polled". #659b makes that expiry say so — naming the
lead, the poll tool, the two decision calls, and the under-threshold escape — instead of the
bare "Rejected: decision timeout". The 300s value itself is untouched: changing a tuned constant
without data would violate the convention the #647 guard enforces.

**Only a run can settle.** Whether a lead agent, given the notification and the poll tool,
actually decides a plan — i.e. whether the flow completes or always ends in the timeout branch.
Nothing offline can answer that: the path has never executed.

**Cheapest observation.** One run containing any >3-step plan. Grep the verdict/log for
"Rejected: no decision within". Every hit is a 300s stall that a lead failed to resolve; zero
hits with plans present means the flow works. If stalls dominate, the fix is a subscriber for
the notification, not a shorter timeout.

## 7. Older, still unresolved

- **#644 viewport.** Two measured targets conflict: 796px matches the reference image aspect,
  981px matches its content fraction. Changing to 796px took `_measured_deviations` error from
  +9.1% to +23%, so it was reverted. Settling this needs a run at each candidate width scored by
  the real judge, not by pixel arithmetic.
- **#641 round-ledger recommendation at release.** Needs one run's `rounds.jsonl` to validate
  the "a better state was available" selection.
- **`_auto_approve_threshold = 3`.** An unmeasured tuned constant, now newly relevant because
  #658 made the path above it live for the first time. No corpus data exists on plan step
  counts (the path never ran). One run's plans would give the distribution.

---

## Next actions that are still offline-checkable

1. ~~**#658 follow-up.**~~ Done — no subscriber exists; see item 6 and #659b.
2. **`llm_func` annotation.** `utils/memory.py:357` declares `Callable[[str], str]` with the
   comment "Async function" beside it and `await` at the call site; the only caller passes
   `async def`. One-line annotation fix, no behaviour change.
3. **The 363 `bad-function-definition` reports** are overwhelmingly `X: SomeType = None` where
   the annotation should be `Optional[...]`. Mechanical, zero-risk, and each one currently hides
   real `bad-argument-type` findings downstream.
